**Alternate title: Adventures in preparing to give someone else's talk**

### Abstract
While it’s not likely to happen very often, there may come a time in your life that you are tasked with giving a talk that someone else prepared. We’ll discuss how you do your own preparation to communicate the intended message, and doing so in your own voice, and making it your own.  

### Alternate Abstract, Longer Description
While it’s not likely to happen very often, there may come a time in your professional life that you are tasked with giving a talk that someone else prepared. And by prepared, I mean they’ve been the driving force at the company for a new initiative with the background to match, and are responsible for crafting the messaging, diagrams, and partnerships for said initiative. No big deal, right?  

This happened to me, and I will share the experience, and give practical steps to prepare to communicate the talk, using your own voice, and making it your talk.
