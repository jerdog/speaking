## What a global pandemic can teach you about better DevOps practices
***20-30 minute session***

### Abstract
In early 2020 a global pandemic set in motion events which none of us could predict. For us at CircleCI, data from 900k+ devs, 25K orgs, and 30m+ builds/mo provided us some interesting insights into better DevOps practices. In this session, we will seek to uncover what this unique dataset can tell us about high-performing engineering teams, and what trends stand out through the aggregated platform usage.
