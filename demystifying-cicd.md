## Demystifying CI/CD and DevOps
***30-45 minute talk***

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) concepts are increasingly adopted by many technology organizations and teams. CI\CD enables teams to establish processes that increase velocity, collaboration and quality of their codebase. CI/CD enables developer & operations teams to break down unnecessary silos and gain a deeper knowledge of their respective arenas.

In this session the participants will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Participants will learn the core principles of CI/CD, leaving with what will be a good understanding of what it takes to CI/CD.

### Alternate abstract, longer description

While it seems that every week new terms appear to describe DevOps tools, segments, ideas, practices, etc., are they really new? CI/CD, Progressive Delivery, AIOps, GitOps, TreeOps (not real, but who knows, maybe it will be next week?) - are they all the same, or are they just reimagining last week’s buzz words? In this talk Jeremy will first break down a few of these terms, what they mean, how they’re used, and why they may matter for you and your teams. Next, he'll dive deeper into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) concepts, and give you the basic fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
